/// Intro: You are going to travel to another city that is located d miles away from your home city.
///        Your car can travel at most m miles on a full tank and you start with a full tank.
///        Along your way, there are gas stations at distances stop_1, stop_2, ... , stop_n from your home city.
///        What is the minimum number of refills needed?
///
/// Input Format: The first line contains an integer d. The second line contains an integer m.
///               The third line specifies an integer n. Finally, the last line contains
///               integers stop_1, stop_2, ... , stop_n.
///
/// Output Format: Assuming that the distance between the cities is d miles, a car can travel at most m miles
///                on a full tank, and there are gas stations at distances stop_1, stop_2, ... , stop_n along the way,
///                output the minimum number of refills needed. Assume that the car starts with a full tank.
///                If it is not possible to reach the destination, output âˆ’1.
