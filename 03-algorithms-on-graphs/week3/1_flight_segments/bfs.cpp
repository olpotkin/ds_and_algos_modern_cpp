/// Computing the Minimum Number of Flight Segments
/// Breadth first search (minimum number of flight segments)
///
/// Intro: You would like to compute the minimum number of flight segments to get from one city to another one. For
///        this, you construct the following undirected graph: vertices represent cities, there is an edge between two
///        vertices whenever there is a flight between the corresponding two cities. Then, it suffices to find
///        a shortest path from one of the given cities to the other one.
///
/// Task: Given an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges and two vertices u and v, compute the length of
///       a shortest path between u and v (that is, the minimum number of edges in a path from u to v).
///
/// Input: A graph is given in the standard format. The next line contains two vertices u and v.
///
/// Output: Output the minimum number of edges in a path from u to v, or âˆ’1 if there is no path.
