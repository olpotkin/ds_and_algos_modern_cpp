### Section 1: Basic Data Structures

* [Check brackets in the code](https://github.com/olpotkin/ds_and_algos_modern_cpp/blob/master/data-structures/week1/1_brackets_in_code/check_brackets.cpp):
   If the code in S uses brackets correctly, output â€œSuccess" (without the quotes). Otherwise, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched closing bracket, and if there are no unmatched closing brackets, output the 1-based index of the first unmatched opening bracket.

* [Compute tree height](https://tbd):
  Output the height of the tree (optimal solution is required).
