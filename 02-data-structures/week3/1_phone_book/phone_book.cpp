/// Phone book
///
/// Intro: In this problem you will implement a simple phone book manager.
///
/// Task: In this task your goal is to implement a simple phone book manager. It should be able to process the
///       following types of user‚Äôs queries:
///       - add number name. It means that the user adds a person with name name and phone number number to the phone
///         book. If there exists a user with such number already, then your manager has to overwrite the corresponding name.
///       - del number. It means that the manager should erase a person with number number from the phone book. If there
///       is no such person, then it should just ignore the query.
///       - find number. It means that the user looks for a person with phone number number. The manager should reply
///       with the appropriate name, or with string ‚Äúnot found" (without quotes) if there is no such person in the book.
///
/// Input: There is a single integer ùëÅ in the first line ‚Äî the number of queries. It‚Äôs followed by N lines, each of
///        them contains one query in the format described above.
///
/// Output: Print the result of each find query ‚Äî the name corresponding to the phone number or ‚Äúnot found" (without
///         quotes) if there is no person in the phone book with such phone number. Output one result per line in the
///         same order as the find queries are given in the input.
