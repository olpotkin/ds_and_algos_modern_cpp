/// Introduction: You are responsible for collecting signatures from all tenants of a certain building.
///               For each tenant, you know a period of time when he or she is at home. You would like to
///               collect all signatures by visiting the building as few times as possible.
///               The mathematical model for this problem is the following. You are given a set of segments
///               on a line and your goal is to mark as few points on a line as possible so that each segment
///               contains at least one marked point.
///
/// Task: Given a set of ùëõ segments {[a_0, b_0], [a_1, b_1], ... , [a_n‚àí1, b_n‚àí1]} with integer coordinates
///       on a line, find the minimum number m of points such that each segment contains at least one point.
///       That is, find a set of integers X of the minimum size such that for any segment [a_i, b_i] there is a
///       point x ‚àà X such that a_i <= x ‚â§ b_i.
///
/// Input: The first line of the input contains the number n of segments. Each of the following n lines contains
///        two integers a_i and b_i (separated by a space) defining the coordinates of endpoints of the i-th segment.
///
/// Output: Output the minimum number m of points on the first line and the integer coordinates of m points (separated
///         by spaces) on the second line. You can output the points in any order. If there are many such sets of points,
///         you can output any set. (It is not difficult to see that there always exist a set of points of the minimum
///         size such that all the coordinates of the points are integers.)
