///
/// Input: The first line of the input contains the capacity W of a knapsack and the number n of bars of gold.
///        The next line contains n integers w_0, w_1, ... ,w_nâˆ’1 defining the weights of the bars of gold.

/// Output: Output the maximum weight of gold that fits into a knapsack of capacity W.
